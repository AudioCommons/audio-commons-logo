There are two logos, the main horizontal version and a square version with a smaller footprint:

The horizontal logo should be used as default.
The square logo should be used when space is restrained and the horizontal logo would be too small to fit a specified width.

In addition there are simplified black and white versions for each, for use on light and dark background, as well as on certain colours. Refer to the Do's and Don'ts and Web usage pages.
