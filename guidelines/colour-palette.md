#Colour palette

Audio Commons uses two main colours and a supplementary accent colour, as well as two grayscale tones:
Use liberally of white space on print, and use the colours as accents rather than backgrounds on the web.

* Green: #0F783C (R15 G120 B60)
* Blue: #1E5055 (R30 G80 B85)
* Red: #991933 (R153 G25 B51)
* Dark grey: #303030 (RGB48, 81% Black)
* Light grey: #F3F3F3 (RGB243, 5% Black)

The use of gradients is discouraged.
Keep it fresh.
