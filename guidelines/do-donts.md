#Do's and Don'ts

If you wonder if you used the logo right, the table below should help you figure it out.
Make sure the logo stands out clearly, including its colours, and you should be fine with common sense.

As a rule of thumb, the logo must stand out clearly from the background.

* On colour backgrounds, we always use the white or black versions, depending on which is more visible. That way we make it clear that said colour is not part of the brand's identity. At the same time, on the brand's colours, only the white version is properly visible.
* Usually, the higher the saturation, the more the white version is appropriate; the higher the luminosity, the more the black version is appropriate.
* If you are hesitating between the black and white versions, try both and squint your eyes to find out which is more legible.

Do not deform the logo, nor transform it.
If you really need to have it changed, please raise an issue on this github repo with a description of the intended use.
There is an icon only version that is meant to be used on the web (favicons, avatars, etc.). Try not to use it in any other context.
