#Do's and Don'ts

If you wonder if you used the logo right, the table below should help you figure out.
Make sure the logo stands out clearly, including its colours, and you should be fine with common sense.

Do not deform the logo, nor transform it.
If you really need to have it change, please raise an issue with a description of the intended use.
