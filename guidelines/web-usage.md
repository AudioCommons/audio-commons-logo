#Web usage

On the web, you will need to use the logo on backgrounds.
Menu bars will use the  logo's blue, and the logo itself will be a monochrome light grey, without shadow.
Plan a generous breathing space around the logo.

The minimal size of the horizontal logo on the web should be 190px wide or 30px high (not including breathing space).

###Padding & margin
The breathing space on the web is calculated with the font size.
The top and bottom padding are 0.7em; the total height of the logo should be 3.8em.
The left and right padding are 1.4em.

###Icon
The logo is also available as an icon: we use only the waveform in the logo in a square image.
They are available in 128*128px, 64*64px, 32*32px and 16*16px in the export files.
