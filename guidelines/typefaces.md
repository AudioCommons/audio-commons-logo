#Typefaces

The two typefaces used for Audio Commons are Rajdhani (used on the logo, and for titles and subtitles) and Roboto (for regular text)

These open source fonts can be found, for download or css import (along with instructions) on Google Fonts:
* [Rajdhani](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Rajdhani)
* [Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto)

Only the Regular and Bold styles are needed for each font for web usage.
