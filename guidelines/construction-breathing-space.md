#Construction & breathing space

The logo is used with a breathing space defined by using an o's width (see image below).
All exported files in this repository already honor the correct breathing space.

A sharp (no blur) 30% black shadow is used on the colour logos.
That shadow is absent from the black and white versions (as they are more likely to be distracting), and should also be removed when using in small sizes wher it could impair legibility.
